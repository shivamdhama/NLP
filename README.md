In this project,
I have used Natural Language Processing to classify the category of Reviews (whether it is positive or negative).The accuracy was not so good because I used CountVectorized method. Currently, i am working on Sentimental Analysis using NLP with Deep Learning.
Language: Python(Keras)
Algorithms: NLP with Random Forest
Visualization: Pandas and Matplotlib
accuracy: 80%!
